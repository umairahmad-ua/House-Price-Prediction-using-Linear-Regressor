1. Introduction

    •	The main aim of this project is to explain the implementation of Linear Regressor Machine Learning.
    
    •	In this repo, we are provided with structured dataset of house features provided by Kaggel.
    
    •	The task is to linearly trained model on the given dataset using Machine Learning algorithm linear regressor with gradient decent and also with normal equation.
    
    •	The problem of 'House price prediction' is treated as a supervised learning problem.

2. Problem Implementation

    •	Here detailed implementation of ''House price prediction ' problem 
    
Task
Learn Input-Ouput Function
Given a features as an input and predict its price(output)

Goal:
To learn from input to predict output

Input-Output:
Input:
80 feature (numeric and categorical), gathered from house of America.
Output:
Price of the house (continues)

3. Phases of Machine Learning:
Training:

    •	Learning phase.
	Subset of data (Train data) is used to train model.
Testing:

    •	Subset of data is used to evaluate\test trained model.
Application:

    •	Learned \Trained model is used in real world applications.
	Predictions are made on the real world data.

3.1 Phases 1 and 2: Training and Testing
The following sequence of seven steps are followed in these two phases:
Step 1: Import Libraries

Step 2: Read, Understand and Pre-process Train/Test Data

Step 2.1: Read Data

Step 2.2: Understand Data

Step 2.3: Pre-process Data

Step 3: Label Encoding for Train/Test Data

Step 5: Splitting Input vectors and labels

Step 6: Train Machine Learning Algorithms using Training Data

Step 7: Evaluate Machine Learning Algorithms using Test Data

Step 8: Visualization and compression with original and predicted data
